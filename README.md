<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 👉 About The Project

I designed and built an entire JavaScript page, using webpacker, for a hypethetical bistrot type restaurant. In the page you can go around and click on the nav bar menu in order to see the:
*   Homepage content
*   About
*   Menu á la carte
*   Contact

sections that are displayed inside it's own container.
